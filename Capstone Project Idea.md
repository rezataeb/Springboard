In the highly competitive world, one of the major concerns of business owners is how to improve their business reputation. Restaurants owners are not excluded from this fact and they always want to push their businesses out to upper levels. Restaurants owners should be aware of business current state and they need to be updated frequently in order to survive in the market especially in the big cities with more powerful competitors. Business reputation is one of the main area that owners should always take care of that and improve it. In the online world, restaurants reputations can be reflected in the customers’ reviews of some online platforms such as Yelp.
Insight extracted from customers’ reviews can help restaurants owners improve their services which eventually leads to increased reputation, more customers and more revenue.  
In this project, I will use the Yelp dataset as one of the most popular reviews sharing platform amongst people in United States. My main focus would be the restaurants in the city of San Francisco. For acquiring the data which is needed for this project, I will directly use Yelp dataset which is available through this link : 
https://www.yelp.com/dataset/documentation/json
In this project, after wrangling the needed dataset which should include “business” and “review” sub datasets I will start by initial exploratory data analysis,  afterward I dig more into the data and apply some statistical inference techniques on dataset in order to get some reliable ideas and looking for possible interesting areas in reviews. Finally I will apply text analysis algorithms on reviews to recognize the factors that have significant impacts on customers’ opinions which are reflected in their reviews. Using sentiment analysis algorithm in Scikit-learn, I hope to find the model that can help the restaurants’ owners in San Francisco to improve their reputations based on their specific type of food and their current state of reputation. Also the output can be helpful to the people who wants to open new restaurants in the city. 
My final deliverables for this project are an analysis paper, slides along with the Python code. 













Disclaimer : In this project, I will just use the restaurants with more than 20 reviews due to need of enough data that makes our analysis reliable for each restaurant.
